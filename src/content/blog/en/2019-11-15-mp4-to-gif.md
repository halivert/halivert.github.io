We, dev people, have the need to post evidence of different behaviors of our
desktop in many places (issues, documentation, blogs, etc.).

In this post, We'll learn how to convert an mp4 file to gif in two simple steps.

### Requirements

- [ImageMagick][]
- [FFmpeg][]

### Instructions
First, we need to extract the frames from our video. FFmpeg can do it with the
next command:<!-- Keep reading -->

```shell
ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vf fps=5 frames/%03d.png
```

The fps option defines the playback speed of the gif, I suggest between 5 and 6
to get closer to speed of the original video.

Then we "glue" the frames to make the gif.


```shell
convert frames/* output.gif
```

With this, we have ready our gif, but maybe it's too big, so we can do the next
step. Gif optimization.

```shell
convert output.gif -fuzz 1% -layers Optimize optimized.gif
```

### Extra

1. For the naming part: `%03d.png` we need to multiply fps times seconds in the
   video, so, if our video lasts up to 166 seconds (2 minutes and 46 seconds)
   and we are using 6 fps, we can use `%03d.png`, but if the video is longer, it
   could be necessary change the names to `%04d.png`, in order to have the
   frames sorted.

2. The fuzz percentage partly determines the optimized gif quality, that's why
   we use only 1%, you will notice that increasing that percentage will reduce
   the final quality.
