<h1 class="title is-1">More about me</h1>

I'm a [Jehova's witness][1] and I'm studying a [bachelor's degree in computer
engineering][2] at ESCOM (México). I'm happily married with the love of my life
since I was 26.

I love math and algorithms, I participated in the algorithms club at my school
for some time. I currently work as a frontend web developer and I mainly use
Angular but sometimes work on little tasks on backend with Java.

I like to practice swimming, table tennis, and a long time ago, skateboarding.

I have a broad musical taste, starting with my favourite band: the Strokes, to
CHON, Wintergatan, up to one (1) Beatles song.
